# SNO VMware fixes for this lab

This repo version is fixed for the current pod-22 VMware SNO hub design.

## SNO networking

The SNO hub VM uses one NIC only:

```yaml
sno_node:
  primary_interface: ens192
  secondary_nic_enabled: false
  mac_eth1: ""
  secondary_interface: ""

vm_network_eth0: MGMT
vm_network_eth1: ""
```

Do not attach VLAN522 to the SNO hub. VLAN522 can be used later for other lab hosts or workloads, but the hub itself only needs the VLAN3522 machine network.

## vSphere disk UUID

The VM creation playbook enforces:

```text
disk.EnableUUID = TRUE
```

This is done with `scripts/set-vm-advanced-setting.py` through pyVmomi after the VM is created or updated.

## Clean rebuild after changing NIC config

If an earlier Agent ISO was generated with two NICs, remove the old build state and regenerate:

```bash
rm -rf build/hub-sno
ansible-playbook -i inventories/pod22/hosts.yml playbooks/01_render_agent_iso.yml --ask-vault-pass
ansible-playbook -i inventories/pod22/hosts.yml playbooks/02_create_vsphere_vm.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

For a full VM recreate, set:

```yaml
sno_vm_recreate: true
```

Then run `02_create_vsphere_vm.yml`. Set the value back to `false` afterwards.

## Port group creation on distributed switches

If vCenter discovery shows only `MGMT` and a distributed switch uplink object such as
`DSwitch-DVUplinks-18`, the ESXi host is probably using a vSphere Distributed Switch
rather than a standard `vSwitch0`. In that case, keep:

```yaml
vm_network_eth0: MGMT
vm_network_eth1: ""
sno_primary_portgroup_auto_create: false
sno_primary_portgroup_create_mode: auto
sno_primary_dvs_name: DSwitch
sno_primary_portgroup_vlan_id: 0
```

Use VLAN ID `0` when the ESXi physical uplink is on an access switchport for VLAN 3522.
Use VLAN ID `3522` only when the uplink is trunking tagged VLAN 3522.

The VM creation playbook will first try a standard vSwitch. If `vSwitch0` is not present,
it will create the `VLAN3522` distributed port group on the configured DVS through vCenter.


## Second 300 GB disk

The SNO VM definition includes a second 300 GB thin disk for later use:

```yaml
sno_vm_extra_disk_enabled: true
sno_vm_extra_disk_gb: 300
sno_vm_extra_disk_type: thin
```

The playbook attaches the disk only. It does not create a filesystem, StorageClass, or mount inside RHCOS/OpenShift.

## Automatic Agent ISO disconnect

Agent ISO installs need the VM to boot from CD-ROM for the first boot only. After RHCOS is written to disk, the VM must boot from disk. The wait playbook monitors `.openshift_install.log` and disconnects the CD-ROM when it sees `Writing image to disk: 100%`, then sets the boot order to disk first.

```yaml
sno_auto_disconnect_iso_after_disk_write: true
sno_set_boot_disk_first_after_iso_disconnect: true
```

A standalone helper is also available:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventories/pod22/hosts.yml playbooks/03_disconnect_agent_iso.yml --ask-vault-pass
```
